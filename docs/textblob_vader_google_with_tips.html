","Laura: HE-- HE THINKS I'M SEEING SOMEONE. ","Laura: THAT'S HOW THIS WHOLE THING STARTED. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. ","Laura: WELL, WE WERE WATCHING TV.

","Laura: THE WHOLE THING WAS REALLY SCARY TO HIM, I THINK. ","Laura: OF WHAT? ","Laura: I WASN'T SUGGESTING THAT WE SPLIT UP. THAT'S NOT THE POINT. ","Laura: I DIDN'T INITIATE ANYTHING. ","Laura: BECAUSE HE'S RIGHT. ","Laura: ANDREW'S RIGHT. ","Laura: I AM BEING UNFAITHFUL TO HIM. ","Laura: NOT JUST LAST NIGHT. ","Laura: I'VE-- I'VE BEEN UNFAITHFUL TO HIM FOR A LONG TIME.

","Laura: NO NO NO, HE HAD THIS THING WITH THE ON AND O-- ","Laura: THE ULTIM-- ","Laura: YEAH, OKAY, ","Laura: I WAS THE FIRST ONE TO SAY IT, YOU'RE RIGHT. ","Laura: BUT HE JUMPED ALL OVER IT. I SAID I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WANT. ","Laura: AND HE SAID, \"YOU HAVE A DAY OR TWO MAX TO DECIDE WHAT YOU WANT.\" ","Laura: AND I SAID \"FINE.\" AND THEN HE STARTED CRYING ","Laura: AND BLAH BLAH BLAH. ","Laura: THE WHOLE THING WAS REALLY SCARY TO HIM, I THINK. ","Laura: OF WHAT? ","Laura: I WASN'T SUGGESTING THAT WE SPLIT UP. THAT'S NOT THE POINT. ","Laura: I DIDN'T INITIATE ANYTHING. ","Laura: BECAUSE HE'S RIGHT. ","Laura: ANDREW'S RIGHT. ","Laura: I AM BEING UNFAITHFUL TO HIM. ","Laura: NOT JUST LAST NIGHT. ","Laura: I'VE-- I'VE BEEN UNFAITHFUL TO HIM FOR A LONG TIME. ","Laura: I THINK WE HAVE. ","Laura: IT'S BEEN HERE ALL ALONG. ","Laura: YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU'VE NEVER NOTICED IT? ","Laura: YOU'RE SURPRISED. ","Laura: THIS ISN'T THE REACTION I WAS HOPING FOR. ","Laura: NOT AT ALL. ","Laura: I-- I HAD... ","Laura: TWO SCENARIOS IN MY HEAD. ","Laura: IN THE FIRST ONE YOU STAND UP AND YOU HUG ME... ","Laura: AND YOU SAY, \"I LOVE YOU.

","Laura: IT'S LIKE THE FIRST ONE BUT-- ","Laura: BUT WITHOUT THE SEX. ","Laura: WE JUST SIT HERE TOGETHER. ","Laura: YOU KNOW, I'M-- I'M-- I'M EMBARRASSED TO EVEN TALK ABOUT IT. ","Laura: I MEAN, YOU'RE SITTING THERE LIKE A FUCKING BUDDHA ","Laura: ACTING LIKE YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. IT'S HUMILIATING. ","Laura: A YEAR... ","Laura: FROM THE FIRST SESSION.

","Laura: YOU KNOW WHY I DIDN'T FUCK THAT GUY? ","Laura: NOT BECAUSE OF ANDREW. ","Laura: NOT BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO CHEAT ON HIM. ","Laura: I DO WANT TO CHEAT ON HIM-- ","Laura: BUT WITH YOU. ","Laura: WHEN I WAS SITTING THERE AT THE BAR BY MYSELF, ","Laura: I WAS THINKING WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU WERE TO WALK IN? ","Laura: YOU'D WALK IN, YOU'D-- YOU'D SIT NEXT TO ME AT THE BAR, ","Laura: YOU'D ORDER A DRINK. I'D EVEN-- ","Laura: I EVEN TRIED TO IMAGINE WHAT YOU WOULD ORDER-- ","Laura: A SHOT OF BOURBON MAYBE, SOMETHING EXPENSIVE, ","Laura: SOMETHING FANCY. THEN WE'D START TALKING-- ","Laura: WHAT A COINCIDENCE IT IS TO MEET LIKE THIS, ","Laura: HOW AWKWARD IT IS TO MEET OUTSIDE THE OFFICE. ","Laura: AND THEN, WITHOUT WORDS, ","Laura: BECAUSE WE-- WE TALK ENOUGH WHEN WE'RE HERE, ","Laura: YOU MOTION FOR ME TO FOLLOW YOU TO THE BATHROOM. ","Laura: AND I DO. ","Laura: WHEN I WENT INTO THE STALL WITH THAT GUY... ","Laura: I IMAGINED IT WAS YOU BEHIND ME. ","Laura: THAT'S WHAT MADE IT SO EXCITING.

","Laura: I TELL MYSELF THAT EVERY TIME I WALK OUT OF HERE. ","Laura: I KNOW IT, I UNDERSTAND IT BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT MY BODY UNDERSTANDS IT. ","Laura: I KNOW IT CAN NEVER HAPPEN. I KNOW IT. ","Laura: SO DON'T WORRY. I'M NOT GONNA START SHOWING UP HERE. ","Laura: I'M NOT GONNA START STALKING YOU ","Laura: LIKE GLENN CLOSE IN THAT MOVIE. ","Laura: I'M NOT GONNA BOIL YOUR KIDS' RABBIT. ","Laura: I'M NOT DANGEROUS... ","Laura: AT LEAST NOT TO YOU. ","Laura: GOD, HOW CAN I GO BACK TO MY LIFE, ","Laura: NOT TO ANDREW, WHEN THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS TO ME IS YOU.

ARE YOU CRAZY?\" ","Laura: AND HE JUST-- IT WAS JUST GETTING REALLY STRANGE. I MEAN, IT WAS TENSE. ","Laura: HIS TONE CHANGED. ","Laura: AND THEN-- AND THEN I THOUGHT OF YOU... ","Laura: WHAT YOU'D SAY ABOUT IT. ","Laura: I THOUGHT ABOUT US GOING THROUGH THIS IN THERAPY. ","Laura: I IMAGINED YOU NOT BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT... ","Laura: THAT YOU'D BE DISGUSTED. ","Laura: I DIDN'T RUN. ","Laura: I GAVE HIM THE HAND JOB. ","Laura: EXCUSE ME. ","Laura: YEAH. YEAH, I'M FINE. ","Laura: YEAH. ","Laura: THANK YOU. ","Laura: I DON'T WANNA BE PUT IN THIS POSITION. ","Laura: I DON'T WANNA HAVE THIS POWER TO DECIDE OUR FUTURE ","Laura: FOR BOTH OF US. I JUST DON'T. ","Laura: NOTHING. I DON'T KNOW. HE JUST LOST IT. ( chuckles ) ","Laura: I MEAN, SHIT, DON'T YOU KNOW THAT MEN ARE THE NEW WOMEN? ","Laura: OBSESSED WITH WEDDINGS AND CHILDREN. ","Laura: AND LATELY HE'S LOST TOUCH WITH REALITY. ","Laura: HE-- HE THINKS I'M SEEING SOMEONE. ","Laura: THAT'S HOW THIS WHOLE THING STARTED. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. ","Laura: WELL, WE WERE WATCHING TV. BUT BEFORE THAT ","Laura: WE WERE HAVING DINNER AND HE HAD THIS LOOK ON HIS FACE. ","Laura: HE HAD THIS SAD LOOK AND I COULD JUST TELL SOMETHING WAS UP. ","Laura: I MEAN, YOU CAN JUST TELL, RIGHT? ","Laura: AND I SAID TO HIM, \"WHAT'S GOING ON?\" AND HE SAID, ","Laura: THIS ON-AND-OFF THING.\" SO I SAID TO HIM, ","Laura: NO, HE'S THE ONE. HE-- HE HAD THE PROBLEM WITH THE ON-AND-OFF THING. ","Laura: NO NO NO, HE HAD THIS THING WITH THE ON AND O-- ","Laura: THE ULTIM-- ","Laura: YEAH, OKAY, ","Laura: I WAS THE FIRST ONE TO SAY IT, YOU'RE RIGHT. ","Laura: BUT HE JUMPED ALL OVER IT. I SAID I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WANT. ","Laura: AND HE SAID, \"YOU HAVE A DAY OR TWO MAX TO DECIDE WHAT YOU WANT.\" ","Laura: AND I SAID \"FINE.\" AND THEN HE STARTED CRYING ","Laura: AND BLAH BLAH BLAH. ","Laura: THE WHOLE THING WAS REALLY SCARY TO HIM, I THINK. ","Laura: OF WHAT? ","Laura: I WASN'T SUGGESTING THAT WE SPLIT UP. THAT'S NOT THE POINT. ","Laura: I DIDN'T INITIATE ANYTHING. ","Laura: BECAUSE HE'S RIGHT. ","Laura: ANDREW'S RIGHT. ","Laura: I AM BEING UNFAITHFUL TO HIM. ","Laura: NOT JUST LAST NIGHT. ","Laura: I'VE-- I'VE BEEN UNFAITHFUL TO HIM FOR A LONG TIME. ","Laura: I THINK WE HAVE. ","Laura: IT'S BEEN HERE ALL ALONG. ","Laura: YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU'VE NEVER NOTICED IT? ","Laura: YOU'RE SURPRISED. ","Laura: THIS ISN'T THE REACTION I WAS HOPING FOR. ","Laura: NOT AT ALL. ","Laura: I-- I HAD... ","Laura: TWO SCENARIOS IN MY HEAD. ","Laura: IN THE FIRST ONE YOU STAND UP AND YOU HUG ME... ","Laura: AND YOU SAY, \"I LOVE YOU. ","Laura: I LOVE YOU TOO, LAURA. ","Laura: I'VE BEEN FEELING THIS WAY FOR A LONG TIME. ","Laura: I JUST WANTED YOU TO BE THE FIRST ONE TO SAY IT.\" ","Laura: AND THEN WE MAKE LOVE. ","Laura: IT'S LIKE THE FIRST ONE BUT-- ","Laura: BUT WITHOUT THE SEX. ","Laura: WE JUST SIT HERE TOGETHER. ","Laura: YOU KNOW, I'M-- I'M-- I'M EMBARRASSED TO EVEN TALK ABOUT IT. ","Laura: I MEAN, YOU'RE SITTING THERE LIKE A FUCKING BUDDHA ","Laura: ACTING LIKE YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. IT'S HUMILIATING. ","Laura: A YEAR... ","Laura: FROM THE FIRST SESSION. I THOUGHT IT WOULD GO AWAY. ","Laura: I THOUGHT IT'S JUST AN INFATUATION, THAT'S ALL. ","Laura: BUT IT'S GETTING WORSE. ","Laura: YOU'VE BECOME THE CENTER OF MY LIFE. ","Laura: YOU KNOW WHY I DIDN'T FUCK THAT GUY? ","Laura: NOT BECAUSE OF ANDREW. ","Laura: NOT BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO CHEAT ON HIM. ","Laura: I DO WANT TO CHEAT ON HIM-- ","Laura: BUT WITH YOU. ","Laura: WHEN I WAS SITTING THERE AT THE BAR BY MYSELF, ","Laura: I WAS THINKING WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU WERE TO WALK IN? ","Laura: YOU'D WALK IN, YOU'D-- YOU'D SIT NEXT TO ME AT THE BAR, ","Laura: YOU'D ORDER A DRINK. I'D EVEN-- ","Laura: I EVEN TRIED TO IMAGINE WHAT YOU WOULD ORDER-- ","Laura: A SHOT OF BOURBON MAYBE, SOMETHING EXPENSIVE, ","Laura: SOMETHING FANCY. THEN WE'D START TALKING-- ","Laura: WHAT A COINCIDENCE IT IS TO MEET LIKE THIS, ","Laura: HOW AWKWARD IT IS TO MEET OUTSIDE THE OFFICE. ","Laura: AND THEN, WITHOUT WORDS, ","Laura: BECAUSE WE-- WE TALK ENOUGH WHEN WE'RE HERE, ","Laura: YOU MOTION FOR ME TO FOLLOW YOU TO THE BATHROOM. ","Laura: AND I DO. ","Laura: WHEN I WENT INTO THE STALL WITH THAT GUY... ","Laura: I IMAGINED IT WAS YOU BEHIND ME. ","Laura: THAT'S WHAT MADE IT SO EXCITING. ","Laura: THEN THAT GUY STARTED PEEING ","Laura: AND IT WOKE ME UP AND I REALIZED THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. ","Laura: I KNOW IT, I UNDERSTAND IT. ","Laura: I TELL MYSELF THAT EVERY TIME I WALK OUT OF HERE. ","Laura: I KNOW IT, I UNDERSTAND IT BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT MY BODY UNDERSTANDS IT. ","Laura: I KNOW IT CAN NEVER HAPPEN. I KNOW IT. ","Laura: SO DON'T WORRY. I'M NOT GONNA START SHOWING UP HERE. ","Laura: I'M NOT GONNA START STALKING YOU ","Laura: LIKE GLENN CLOSE IN THAT MOVIE. ","Laura: I'M NOT GONNA BOIL YOUR KIDS' RABBIT. ","Laura: I'M NOT DANGEROUS... ","Laura: AT LEAST NOT TO YOU. ","Laura: GOD, HOW CAN I GO BACK TO MY LIFE, ","Laura: NOT TO ANDREW, WHEN THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS TO ME IS YOU.
