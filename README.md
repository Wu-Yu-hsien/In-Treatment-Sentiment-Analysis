# In-Treatment Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview

This project explores how Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be used to analyze emotional shifts in psychotherapy conversations. Drawing from the HBO series *In Treatment*, the project visualizes the sentiment trajectory of a patient—Laura—across six therapy sessions, using three different sentiment analysis tools:

- **TextBlob** (lexicon-based)
- **VADER** (rule-based)
- **Google Cloud Natural Language API** (machine learning-based)

The result is an interactive, multi-panel line chart that allows users to explore how these tools interpret emotional tone throughout the therapy dialogues.

> 💡 This project demonstrates how NLP tools might support therapists or clients in identifying emotional turning points or patterns over time.

## Why *In Treatment*?

Due to privacy and ethical concerns around using real clinical transcripts, this project uses data from *In Treatment*, where each episode closely simulates a real therapy session. All dialogue was sourced from subtitle files and manually labeled with speaker roles.

## Sentiment Tools

Each tool brings different strengths:

- **TextBlob**: Assigns sentence-level sentiment scores by averaging word-level polarity values.
- **VADER**: Incorporates rule-based adjustments for emphasis, punctuation, and informal language.
- **Google Cloud NLP**: Uses a deep learning model to assess sentence sentiment within broader context.

Each sentence was scored independently by all three tools, with values normalized between -1 (very negative) and +1 (very positive).

## Key Features

- 🧠 Compare three sentiment models across six therapy sessions  
- 📈 Visualize emotional trends of both therapist (Paul) and patient (Laura)  
- 🔍 Hover to view full dialogue and sentiment score  
- 📊 Zoom, filter, and isolate any line using the interactive legend

## To use Google Cloud NLP:
Create a Google Cloud project

Enable the Natural Language API

Generate a service account key (JSON format)

Set your API credentials in your script:
import os
os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"] = "path_to_your_api_key.json"
⚠️ Note: Google Cloud offers 5,000 free requests per month.
TextBlob and VADER can be used immediately without any setup.
